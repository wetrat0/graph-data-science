This means you can simply run all Gradle commands by running `./gradlew TASK` from the repository root.

Running tests::
To run all tests you can simply run `./gradlew check`

Packaging the library::
To package the library you can run `./gradlew packaging:shadowJar`.
This will create the bundeled jar at `packaging/build/libs/neo4j-graph-data-science-VERSION-standalone.jar`.

Preview of the Documentation::
To generate a preview you can run `./gradlew doc:preview`.
This will build the documentation and make it available under `http://localhost:8001/`.
When you are done run `./gradlew doc:stopPreview` to stop the web server.
